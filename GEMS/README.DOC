GEMS Driver - Update Version 2.5 for Microtec               5/21/91
=============================================

GEMS Update Version 2.5 is an update for any previous GEMS
version 2 (2.0, 2.1, or 2.2). If you do not have one
of these GEMS releases to apply this update to, download
the 2.0 release from the Sega BBS, and then apply this
update to it (4 files are replaced). Don't bother getting
the 2.1 or 2.2 stuff - it is all replaced by this release.

Included in GEMS25.ZIP
along with this file are 4 files which should replace
the corresponding files in the GEMS subdirectory of the
original 2.0 (or updated to 2.1 or 2.2) release:

     GEMS.EXE - the GEMS development system for DOS
     GEMS.ABS - the ROM image for the Sega RAM/ROM board
     GEMS.A   - the 68k assembly routines for use in a game
     Z80.ASM  - the Z80 program in dc.b format for use in a game

NOTE: The SHIP example in the 2.0 release has a separate copy
of GEMS.A in the directory SHIP\MUSIC. Replace this GEMS.A as
well before attempting to build SHIP with this update.

Feel free to contact Jonathan Miller at Extended Play
at (415) 469-9755 with problems, questions, or comments.

GEMS 2.5 Release Notes
======================

New Features:
-------------

1) Volume Control. GEMS now provides opcodes for modifying the volume
of FM patches. Volume adjustment is not provided for PSG and Digital
patches. Note that a volume change only affects subsequent notes.
Notes which are already ringing will not be effected.

FM volume is adjustable on a channel by channel basis using
the MIDI Volume Control Change message (Controller #7). Volume values
range from 0 (off) to 127 (loudest). A volume setting of 127 plays the
patch at the same volume it would play at in previous version of GEMS.
The volume opcode is also supported in the Sequence Editor.

There is also a Master Volume opcode, available only in the Sequence
Editor (there is no MIDI controller for this opcode.) Master volume
also ranges from 0 to 127, and also only affects FM. Master volume
affects all FM channels, and can therefore be used to fade a song.

2. 4-bit Samples. A very simple data compression technique is now
supported for digital samples. A new switch in the Sample Editor allows
for the selection between 8-bit (the only mode previously supported)
and 4-bit samples. In 4-bit mode, only the most significant 4 bits of
each sample are sent to the Genesis. The resulting data takes half the
space, but at a significant degradation in sound quality.

NOTE: The sample files imported into GEMS are still 8-bit files,
regardless of the selection between 4-bit or 8-bit samples for playback.

3. New Sequence Control Opcodes. The following new opcodes are provided
in the Sequence Editor. There are no MIDI controllers for these opcodes.

     STOP SONG       - stops the specified sequence. The special value
                       of STOP SONG 255 will stop all sequences.

     PAUSE SONG      - pauses the specified sequence.

     RESUME          - resumes any paused sequences.

     PAUSE LEVEL     - pauses the sequence whose number is stored in
                       Mailbox #0.

The PAUSE LEVEL opcode is useful for creating sound effects which pause
the current background music, play the sound effect, and resume the
background music. Since it is useful to have a single sound effect which
can work with any background sequence, the PAUSE LEVEL opcode does not
specify a specific sequence to pause, but rather it uses the value stored
in mailbox #0. It is therefore necessary to place a STORE opcode at the
beginning of each background sequence, to store its own sequence number
into mailbox #0. For example, if sequence 4 contains the background music
for a particular level, you would put the following opcode at the
beginning of sequence 4:

            STORE 4 IN MBOX 0

4. Improved Hot Keys. The assignment of hot keys (<ALT>+<some other key>)
has been modified to increase the number of operations that do not require
a mouse click. (A hot key is indicated by a single, underlined letter
in a menu item or on a button.)

In particular, you can now access the main MODULE menu, even when the
Sequence Bank window is open, by pressing ALT+M. You can now complete
the editing of an opcode by pressing RETURN (ENTER), and can cancel the
opcode by pressing ALT+C. You can now access the Sequence Editor's
SEQUENCE menu (from which you can close the editor) by pressing ALT+S.
Also, ALT+Y, ALT+N and ALT+C now work in yes/no/cancel situations.

Bugs Fixed:
-----------

1) LFO Control. In previous versions of GEMS, playing any FM note would
set the value of the single, shared LFO, even if the note did not use
the LFO. In 2.5, the LFO frequency is only adjusted if the FM patch
has the LFO enabled.

Since the LFO is now generally running, it is important that FM patches
which do not want any effect from the LFO have the AMS and PMS fields
set to 0 (this is the default when a new FM patch is created.)


Release Notes from 2.2
======================

Warnings:
---------

1) "\" in names. The Sound Module Compiler includes the names of
patches, sequences, modulators, and samples in the output files,
*.ASM, as comments. If any of the names in the sound module contain backslash
characters ("\"), you may get some or no sound from your game:
If "\" is the continuation character for your
assembler, the next line of the file will be appended
to the line with the "\", which is a comment field. This loss of
data from the sound data tables in very difficult to diagnose, so
be safe and search for "\" in the files.

2) Zero duration loops - Be careful to avoid any GEMS sequencer loops
having 0 duration (a LOOP START followed by a LOOP END on the same tick).
This will hang the GEMS sequencer. Though you are unlikely to create such
a case, it can get tricky when using GOTO and LABEL - a GOTO transfers
the sequencer to the LABEL opcode with 0 delay.


New Features:
-------------

1) MPU-401 Port Address Selection. It is now possible to set the
I/O port address of the MPU-401 MIDI interface. The previous GEMS
DOS program assumed an I/O base address of 330(hex). To select
a different address, add the command line switch:

     "-a <new address in hex>"

when invoking GEMS. For example, to start GEMS with an MPU401 located
at address 300(hex), and using interrupt IRQ2, type:

     gems -a 300 -i 2

2) The old GEMS had a command line switch "-ng" for use without a
Genesis. This switch also disabled MIDI. There are now two separate
switches:

     "-ng"     for use without a Genesis - however, MIDI is enabled

     "-nm"     for use without an MPU401 - however, the Genesis is expected

Use both switches ("gems -nm -ng") for use without a Genesis and wihout MIDI.


Bugs Fixed:
-----------

1) Pitchbend Initialization - Previous drivers did not automatically
reset a GEMS sequencer channel's pitchbend to 0 when a sequence was
started. Pitchbend values left over from previous sequences running
on that channel would therefore affect the new sequence. The pitchbend
value is now initialized to 0 at sequence start time. (GEMS.ABS,Z80.ASM)

2) Sound Module Compiler and Samples - The previous sound module compiler
would emit garbage in DBANK.ASM if unused slots in the sample bank were
followed by used slots. This is fixed. (GEMS.EXE)

3) Handshaking in gemsdmastart() - The handshaking between the 68000 and Z80
for preventing Z80 accesses to cart space during DMA had a timing problem
which could occassionally allow the Z80 accesses before DMA completed.
This is fixed. (GEMS.A,Z80.ASM)

4) RAM Utilization on the RAM/ROM card - GEMS used to allocated patches,
modulators, and sequences in the first 64k of RAM on the RAM/ROM card,
and samples in the second 64k of RAM. This limited sequences to about
45k before crashing (literally) into the samples. The symptom was that
a module with more than 45k of sequence data would play fine until any
sample was loaded. Samples are now allocated from the end of the the 128k
of RAM, working back towards the sequences. While the error checking is
still weak here, at least RAM utilization is maximized.

5) Notes ringing after gemspauseall() or gemsstopsong() - notes which
were on when a pause or stopsong was issued from the 68k used to ring
to completion. These are now clipped as appropriate.
