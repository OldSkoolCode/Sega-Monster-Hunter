RE:             GEMS and the Mega CD

OTHER FILES:    Z80CDROM.ASM, PZCDROM.S, ZMAC.MAC, CDGEMS.C


This patch makes GEMS kind of work in the Mega CD environment. The
basic problem is that the Z80 cannot directly access the shared
RAM from the Mega CD. This RAM is where the GEMS module (*.ASM)
data goes since there is no cartridge. The GEMS Z80 code is designed
to directly access and transfer the data from the cart, so it just
don't work in the Mega CD.

This patch replaces the Z80 routine XFER68K which normally does
a Z80 DMA from cartridge space, with a version of XFER68K which
simply posts the request in Z80 RAM. This XFER68K then waits for
the 68000 to come around, see the request, and do the transfer for
the Z80. This modified Z80 driver is contained in "dc.b" format
(for assembling with a 68000 assembler) in the file "Z80CDROM.ASM".
To use the file, modify the statement in the file "GEMS.A":

    include ..\gems\z80.asm

to include "Z80CDROM.ASM" instead.

The C routine ServiceZ80DMA() is contained in the file "CDGEMS.C". 
ServiceZ80DMA should 
be called several times per 60 Hz tick to check to see if the Z80 needs
any data. Since this type of transfer is polled instead of demand driven,
the real-time performance is not very good. This patch will be best
for doing FM sound effects through GEMS, although I believe one CD
developer is actually playing FM music. They claim that they simply
recoded ServiceZ80DMA() in assembly, and then call it several times
per tick.

If you're inspired and want to hack around with the Z80 driver, I've
included it in source form ("PZCDROM.S"). Note that we actually use a
68000 macro set to simulate a Z80 assembler. That's why certain Z80
opcodes will have a "z" infront of them -- to avoid a conflict with
the 68000 opcodes. The MPW Macro file "ZMAC.MAC" is also included, as
it contains a few macros used in "PZCDROM.S".

Good Luck,
Jon
