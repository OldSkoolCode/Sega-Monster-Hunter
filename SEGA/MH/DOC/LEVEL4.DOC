				LEVEL 4 - The Temple

	Your travels take you to Japan, to the island of Honshu.  A serene Shinto temple
is nestled in an array of bonsai trees and rock gardens. Peacefull Koto music and wafts of fragrant incense beckon you through the rice paper doors at the entrance. Once inside you see the smoke from the incense urns on the tatami mats solidify and form fire breathing wyverns.
There are two sets of urns in each room. Your shots will cause the wyverns to disipitate, but another one quickly takes its place. You will prevent any more from appearing by destroying the
urns....if you can shoot the urns while defending yourself from the wyvern's brutal attack. Some
of the urns you destroy will have some power-ups hidden in them. 
	After many rooms of this, you finally come to a large statue of a 5-headed Hydra in a
shrine room. The beast springs to life on your arrival, and bombards you with a different breath weapon from each head. One head shoots a spray of acid, one shoots a fireball, one shoots an
ice storm, one shoots a billow of toxic smoke, and one shoots a sticky kind of tar. You can counter any of its blasts with your flame thrower.....you could be severely damaged if you don't!
The beast itself is immune to fire so you'll have to shoot bullets toward each neck. If the sticky
tar-like substance envelopes you, you'll have to wait for it to drip off before being able to see where you're firing. Once you shoot all its necks, it will collapse in a green bloodied heap. You
stick the dripping heads into your bag and move on.
	The screen now scrolls right to left. You're in a hallway will pillars to either side. Along the walls are grey temple lion statues. As you approach, they turn golden and jump to life. They're similar to living golems that are composed of solid metal. Due to their tough exterior,
they are very hard to kill. Once you do, though, they shatter into little bits of scrap metal. If you blast some of the pillars, you may find some power-ups or an explosive bag of kitty litter. The kitty litter bags act as smart bombs, destroying all the lions on the screen.
	Once you pass the lion stage, you meet the boss of the lions: a big, husky Russian lion-tamer. One of his hands grips a steel chair which he'll use to deflect your bullets and the other holds a long whip. If the Ruskie thinks he's losing, he'll call on some lions to assist him.  He
moves the chair around in different patterns. Once you figure them out, you can shoot around the chair and hit him. He also moves from side to side, making him a difficult target to hit.
When you finally fill him full of lead, he keels over in a pool of blue blood (Being an icy native of
Siberia has given him blue blood).  You toss his head into your bag and journey onward.
	Now you're scrolling back into the 1st person view again. As you make your way down the pillared hallway, Zombie Ninjas jump out of the darkness, throwing nasty shurikens and knives at you. Being far away and quick on their feet, they can be a hard target to lock down.
The closer they get, the more damage they can inflict. When shot, the pillars can reveal power-ups and explosive gravestones. A gravestone will kill the closest group of Ninjas to it when it explodes.	
	After the arduous fighting ceases, you reach the main temple area. An immense statue of a Samurai towers to the ceiling on the southern most wall. A Ninja dressed in black magically
appears before you and throws poison tipped shurikens from each hand. A split second later he
disappears in a puff of smoke and reappears in another random area, continuing his assault.
Your objective is to shoot him while he's visible, but at the same time try to deflect the shurikens
that cause considerable damage at close range. At any point in time the Black Ninja can summon two Zombie Ninjas to his aid. Some of the temple offerings around the room are disguised as power-ups.
	When you're done with that blast fest, the Giant Samurai Warrior awakes from his slumber and unsheathes his sword. You can only harm the Undead Warrior by directing your blasts to the ying-yang symbol on his helmet. Your problems mount when he decides to summon a Black Ninja to help him; who in turn can summon a Zombie Ninja to his aid!
Firing at parts of the ceiling could send an avalanche of masonry onto him. There are also Japanese Kanji symbols on the walls that can trigger a searing bolt of energy to lash out at your
foes when shot.
	When the mayhem is finally over with, the Undead Samurai body decomposes before your eyes until only his helmet remains. You throw it into your sack and gratefully leave the temple for your next challenge.
