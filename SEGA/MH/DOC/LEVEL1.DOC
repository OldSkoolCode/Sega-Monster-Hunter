				LEVEL 1 - The Sewer

	You start level 1 at the entrance of a dark and slimey sewer tunnel. Slow, ominous music plays as you traverse the tunnels. A stream of green, toxic sewage with various bits of waste floating in it, flows out of drainage pipes along the wall.
             You stop in a large antechamber. The screen scrolls up and you see dozens of winged roaches crawling along the ceiling.  Suddenly they spread their wings and pounce down on to the screen. There doesn't appear to be an exit to this room. Their onslaught increases as numbers of them pour out from cracks in the walls. There are secret spots on the wall where,
if you hit a certain area of bricks, a can of raid or a power-up vial will appear. The can of raid is rare to get, since it acts as a smart bomb that will kill all the roaches currently on the screen at that time. After killing off the entire militia of roaches, a rumble is felt (the screen shakes a bit).
Then, the northern wall (previously a dead end) shatters dramatically....leaving a huge hole. Out
of the hole crawls the gargantuan Queen of the Cockroaches. Her razor sharp limbs slash wildly in your direction. Her endoskeleton is impervious to harm, yet her two antenae and head are vulnerable. Hitting it the right amount of times will cause it to rupture and leave a bloody (orange)
mess on your screen.  You add her carcass into your trophy bag and continue your travels through the hole in the wall.
               The hole leads through more dark tunnels that have a few power-ups disguised as skulls along the wall. The screen begins to scroll left to right. As you wade through the river of sewage, you notice movement in the murky depths. Mutant alligators leap out, gnashing their knife-like teeth at you. Just when you thought there were too many attacking you from below, more of them slither out from the side tunnels. If you're lucky, you can shoot some secret bricks in the wall that will cause parts of the ceiling to collapse and crush an area of alligators. Power-ups are also behind some of the hollow bricks. After you kill the last of the alligators, you step into another large antechamber where there seems to be a lake of green bubbling sewage.
	    A slime covered hand rises up from the gurgling depths and claws at you. If you fire
into the lake, a creature will rise up and now you have BOTH its hands to contend with!  The creature looks as if it were part of the lake. The only distinguishing feature are two glowing red
eyes on the side of its head. Shooting these out will cause the creature to scream in pain and slash at you more wildly.  A well placed batch of grenades into its gaping maw will cause the creature to convulse and explode into a rain of green sewage on the screen.
	    The scrolling now reverts back to the 1st person perspective as you continue down the maze-like tunnels. You begin to slow down when you hear a scratching sound in the distance. As you move closer, giant furry rats 6 feet long break through the bars of adjacent tunnels and jump at your throat. Hoards of them follow suit and you must fend off a vertible army of them plowing through the surrounding tunnels. Their rabies infested bite take away large amounts of power from you. Shooting secret bricks in the wall reveal power-up "antidote" vials
and exploding cheese bombs. The cheese bombs look like a regular chunk of swiss cheese that will attract nearby rats to it. It explodes, however, giving the victims a fiery death. When you're done wasting all the vermin, a group of three cool looking giant rats step out of the shadows on their hind legs. One of them is dressed in a black leather jacket, pants and boots. He is wearing
dark shades and holds a spiked baseball bat. Another has a mohawk and is wearing a ripped shirt with ripped jeans. On his feet are hightop sneakers. He wields a heavy chain. The third rat
is in back of the first two and looks bigger than both of them. He is severely mutated with a large hunch on his back. Bulging eyes hang from his face. His needle-like teeth are covered with foam. He's wearing shorts and a sleeveless t-shirt with the words "RATT" on it. He's holding a 
battle axe in one hand and a machette in the other. Their obvious weak spot is in their face. But they move very fast and are difficult to hit. As they die, they collapse in a heap of blue blood.
You put them into your trophy bag and move on.
	     After this deadly battle, you enter a large dark chamber covered in a web and meet the boss of this level.

THE BOSS:  A giant mutated spider (a combination of a tarantula and a black widow) gazes out at you through many dark eyes at the center of the web.  It rears back and shoots a web at you
through its abdomen. If you are quick on the trigger, you can burn the strand of webbing before it
hits the screen. Otherwise you will be tangled in a cocoon (the screen is covered in an intricate web pattern) and must shoot your way through it before you can harm the spider. In the mean-
time, it can take several lethal bites with its mandibles (which are drenched in an acid-like poison that causes considerable damage).  Its weak spot is the red hourglass shape in the center of its abdomen as it rears back to web you.  Once you shoot that area a certain number of times, it will fall onto its back. Its legs then curl up and it dies in a pool of purple blood. You toss
the remains into your bag and the screen fades to black.
