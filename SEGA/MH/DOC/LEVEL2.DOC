				LEVEL 2 - The Jungle

	You start the level in a lush, green South American jungle. The screen scrolls in a 1st person perspective. Trees pass you on your left and right as you creep further into a densely forested area. Suddenly from all around, small, fast, carnivorous dinosaur lizards leap out of bushes and clumps of tall grass. Their needle sharp teeth aim for your jugular as they target you for their next meal.  Your troubles multiply when, further in the forest,  large venomous snakes slink down from the tops of trees and lunge their fangs in your direction. If you shoot certain trees, a power-up vial may fall down for you, or a lethal coconut bomb. The coconut bomb acts as a smart bomb that will shake the screen when it hits the ground (like an earthquake) and kill every creature on the screen.
	When you're done dealing with them, you walk into a clearing with four trees in it. Each
tree comes to life and tries to grab you with its tentacle-like branches. If one latches on to you it will drain your life energy rapidly unless you blast it away. If all four of them lock you in the grip of their branches, you will die immediately. Your objective is to blast away at its exposed roots.
With enough shots, you can blast each one into fire wood. After the fierce battle, you get your trophies and continue on your way.
	You are now out of the jungle and in a clearing of tall grass. You hear an ear piercing shreek. Looking up, you see a posse of Pterodactyls homing in on you like guided missles. They fly blazingly fast and in increasing numbers. When you're done roasting the birds, a giant mutant
two-headed Pterodactyl swoops down on you, trying to bite you with both heads. Your mission is to fire rounds of ammo into each mouth as it opens to bite you. When you've successfully done that, it will fall limp to the ground and become another beautiful trophy piece.
	The screen now moves left to right as you walk further into the tall, wet grass.
You hear a loud rumble and see a cloud of smoke appear on the horizon. A hoard of charging Tricerotops are fleeing from the lava flow of a nearby volcano and you're in their way!  To prevent
from being trampled or impaled on their sharp horns, you have to blast them quickly as they approach from the distance. Their large number can overwhelm you if you're not prepared. They are very hard to kill, due to their tough, thick hide. A precise shot to their eyes or kneecaps will
kill them quicker.
	After you've blasted through the charging army of them, you walk wearily to the entrance of a small village. The screen shifts back to 1st person perspective. You stand at a wooden gateway leading into a quaint, secluded village with numerous huts. A dirt path leads through a clearing of tall grass. Suddenly, a crowd of villagers run out of their homes as a giant Tyranosau-
rus Rex plows its way through the shabby straw huts. It picks up a few stray animals and heaves them into its mouth like popcorn. As you approach it, it eyes you as its next appetizer and stomps towards you, hungrily.  The lizard's giant jaws are almost fatal. If they bite you, you could lose half your lifeline. A flamethrower shot at its eyes or mouth will cause it to fall back, allowing you to advance closer.  If you set some of the damaged huts aflame, it will retreat even further back. From a distance, it uses its massive tail to inflict damage on you. Your objective is to lure it back and over a cliff.  This can be done with the right amount of strategy and timing.
	At the end of the village is a fortified hut off the beaten path. Standing in the doorway is a crazed grey haired scientist. The kind that had taken way too much LSD during the 60's. He holds a beaker of a strange blue liquid. Without reason, he drinks it and begins a startling transformation. He grows to almost three times his size. His skin becomes scaley and green.
His final appearance is that of a Tyranosaurus Rex with the body of a muscular man and the tail of a Stegasaurus. Your weapons seem to be futile against him. The only way to harm him is to shoot at the barrels he picks up and lobs at you. The toxic chemicals will then leak out and drip on him. If you do this many times, a barrel will finally rupture and spill its entire contents on him.
This results in another awkward transformation into a dead, shrivelled, mutated heap. You stash
his decomposed head into your trophy bag and claim victory over the level!
