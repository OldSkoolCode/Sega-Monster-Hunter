				INTRO

Opening Scene:   The Sega logo appears.  The sound of machine gun fire is heard and the logo is riddled with bullet holes. The screen fades to black and the opening title screen appears.
An explosion shatters the title screen picture into a thousand pieces that fly out and bounce off the screen.  The screen quickly fades to a mini movie of the story.  The story may be aborted at
this point by hitting the "start" button at any time.  Once aborted, the options screen will be displayed.

The Story:

Graphic #1: (In a bordered space occupying 3/4 of the screen, a static graphic of a game hunter's room in a mansion is displayed.)  You see monster heads in a locked trophy case on one wall, while a cozy fire burns in a fireplace along another wall. An animal hide from a ferocious polar bear covers the floor next to a plush velvet recliner. Sitting in the chair is your character: a tall, muscular man in his early 30's. He's wearing thick padded kevlar armor over a rugged leather vest and kakhi pants. What you see is a dark 3/4 profile view of him, highlighted on one side by the light of the fire. He is reading the headlines on the front page of a newspaper.

The Text to Graphic #1: (the text appears in the remaining 1/4 of space under the graphic)
"You are Don Bo, the most skilled monster hunter in the world!"

Graphic #2: (the first graphic fades after a set time and the 2nd appears in its place)
The view is now of the newspaper he holds in his hand. It's the 'Sega Enquirer'. The headline
'MONSTER SIGHTED!' can be read.

Text to Graphic #2: "Monsters have been sighted and are causing major chaos everywhere!"

Graphic #3: (This graphic covers the left side of the screen. There is no border or background)
Your character is standing (fully armored) in a dynamic fighting pose. A large belt of ammo is 
around his waist and over his shoulder. He is holding a rather large and deadly looking machine gun. 

Text to Graphic #3: "You feel it's your duty to rid the world of these fiendish creatures!"

Graphic #4: (bordered rectangle occupying the top half of the screen)  A graphic of your monster
head collection in the trophy case.

Text to Graphic #4: "You can also pick up some cool trophies along the way, as well!"

Graphic #5: (the same as graphic #3 except in the center of the screen)

Text to Graphic #5: "So what are you waiting for?....."  (appears on a blank background before Graphic #5 appears. The text fades and then the graphic appears.)
  "Let's ROCK !"  (appears under the graphic)

(a machine gun firing sound is heard and bullet holes appear everywhere, blanketing the screen)

(fade to black)  (options screen then appears)
