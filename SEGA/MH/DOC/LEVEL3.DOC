				LEVEL 3 - The Ocean	

	Your exploits now take you into the depths of the ocean. The screen scrolls left to right as you swim about. In the distance, a school of fish approaches. As they draw nearer, their teeth mark them to be vicious Piranhas. They haven't seen a good meal in days and you just fit the bill! They're pretty easy to kill, but there are hundreds of them travelling in groups. An occasional
electric eel swims up from the depths and tries to zap you. Some of the eels have eaten power-ups and explosive mines.  If you shoot one with an explosive mine, it will destroy the closest group of fish next to it.
	After the laborous battle, a giant blowfish aspires from below. It shoots a hail of poison-
ous quills at you. Its weakness are the gills at its sides. If you shoot them a set amount of times,
it will shrivel up like a popped balloon and die. You carefully put it into your trophy bag and continue on your quest.
	Further into the deep brine, you see what appears to be a group of beautiful dolphins approaching. But Flipper never had two rows of pointy white teeth and an appetite for your blood! You figure they must be sharks. These sharks move swiftly and have no qualms about ripping you to shreds. Their bite inflicts a great deal of damage. If you shoot some of the floating kelp in the water, occasionally you will find power-ups or some explosive lamb chops.  The lamb chops will attract a group of sharks to it, then explode, killing the whole group of them.
	When you're done mindlessly slaughtering the fish, a Russian sub comes out from a cave and heads in your direction. It fires torpedos at an alarming rate. They are very accurate and will drain half your points on contact. Your only hope is to blast the torpedos right when they're near the sub on their route to you. The sub will be caught up in the resulting explosion.
After you've damaged the sub beyond its ability to withstand any more explosions, it will go up
in a huge mushroom cloud.
	You journey deeper into the ocean's depths. The screen scrolls in a 1st person perspective view again. Behind a bed of corral on the ocean floor sits the remanants of an old shipwreck. Curious, you edge your way closer to it. From the shattered hull, an army of skeletons clothed in pirate apparrel, holler a battle cry and storm out in your direction. You have
little choice but to release a barrage of ammo at them. As the battle ensews, you notice two distinctive groups of them. One kind slashes with cutlasses at close range, while the other throws daggers at you from afar.
	When you reduce the hapless fiends into piles of rotted bones on the ocean floor, a giant pirate fully clothed in a lavish pirate captain's uniform, strides out from the rubble. He looks
like Captain Hook on a bad day. It also appears that he's a ghost, since all your shots pass right through him. His sharp rapier seems to find its mark at close range, however. Your only hope to win this battle is to blast away a certain clump of corral that's hiding a treasure chest. He'll go over and open it. When he does, though, it'll draw his spirit essence into it and slam shut (like a genie in a bottle). You can then add it to your prized trophy collection. You'll find some more power-ups located in other clumps of corral.
	You then trudge forward to the mysterious shipwreck. From out of the bow of the ship a 
tentacle whips out at you. Seven more follow suit as the head of a Giant Squid peers out from the darkness. Your objective is to blast off each one of its tentacles and finally shoot out its eyeball. If you're not carefull it can wrap you in one of its two long whip tentacles and squeeze the life out of you. The final shot at its eye will result in splattered squid parts all over your screen. You collect them for your trophy bag and for the next time you have a Japanese guest over for dinner.
