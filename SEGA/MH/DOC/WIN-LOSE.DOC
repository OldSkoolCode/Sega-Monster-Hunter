				Win Screen

	After each level, a snapshot of you with the head of the end level boss is displayed in the frame of a photograph picture.
 	At the begining of each level a different headline will appear on the front page of your
newspaper proclaiming a different monster on the loose. Here they are in order:
LEVEL 1: "GIANT SPIDER SEEN LURKING IN CITY SEWERS!"
LEVEL 2: "DINOSAUR SPOTTED IN SOUTH AMERICAN VILLAGE!"
LEVEL 3: "GIANT SQUID SINKING SHIPS AT THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE!"
LEVEL 4: "UNDEAD LURKING AT EVIL JAPANESE TEMPLE!"
LEVEL 5: "REPORTS OF ASTRONAUTS MISSING AT SPACE STATION!"
LEVEL 6: "RADIOACTIVE MUTANTS BREEDING AT NUCLEAR PLANT!"

      	When you've sucessfully completed all the levels, you will see an animation of yourself
on the top of a limo, driving through a cheering crowd. Confetti rains down on you. Lively music plays.  "Congratulations!" is written at the bottom of the screen. What can follow now is screen- shots of points in the game where you've defeated each of the bosses. 
	You will then be taken to the high score screen to enter your name in. The game then 
restarts back to the intro.

				Lose Screen

	Once your power bar reaches the zero point level, you die. The screen will fade to red.
In two player mode, if one player dies, that player's crosshair will be removed from the screen
and a loud scream of death will be heard. Once both players are out, the screen fades to red and a newspaper headline of your tragic end appears on the front page.  The screen will then
fade back to the options screen where you can enter a password for the last level you were on.
