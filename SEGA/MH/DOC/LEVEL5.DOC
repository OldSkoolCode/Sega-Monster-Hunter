				LEVEL 5 - The Space Station

	Your next mission takes you to an orbiting space station around mars. As you stand in the entranceway, you marvel at the technology of the structure. Rows of computers and flashing red lights are imbedded in the walls. Buttons, levers, and dials are everywhere. If you ever shoot any of them, a number of different things could happen:  a) a bolt of electricity will fly out, zapping anything close to it (including you).  b) The lights will go out in the room (causing the 
contrast to dim)  c) There's a switch to turn them on too.  d) The airlock could open and will suck anying near it out into space (including you).  e) There's a switch that closes it as well.  f) A smart bomb will wipe out every alien in the room (a rare switch).  g) a power-up will appear. You'll find all these objects throughout the level.
	Suddenly all the doors in the room open (there are 3, one on each wall) and Alien Soldiers with laser rifles pour in, giving you little time to enjoy the scenery.  They are quick on
the draw and heavily armored. If you're successfull in destroying all the little green men, their leader slithers into the room.  The leader is a giant slug-like green alien with a very mean disposition and an equally mean Laser Cannon. It's helmet seems to protect its head. The armor
seems to be impenatrable also. The "self-destruct" button on its belt seems to be the only course of action.  After shooting that a number of times, he will start glowing a bright red and finally explode into bits of green alien parts onto the screen. The amber colored blood decorates the walls. You pick up what's left of his head, throw it into your bag, and continue walking.
	In the following few rooms you hear a loud whirring of machinery. Giant Robot "walkers"
are everywhere. The screen scrolls up as you look at them, because of how tall they are.  If
you can shoot out their guns first, they can be easier to destroy. Once you incapacitate its guns, it will use its steel arms to try to pound you into the ground. You will then have to shoot off their arms to fully destroy them.  After that whole ordeal, you meet their boss: a big metal box on the floor. The harmless box is a transformer and changes before your eyes. Arms, legs, torso, guns,
and finally head expand out of the steel cube and form a giant kick-ass robot. It seems to want to pound you with both its arms and fire at you from the guns in its torso at the same time. You have to knock out its four guns first, then its arms, legs, and finally its head.  Before you destroy it, the head will separte from the body and fly around the room. It will ram into you with the spikes in its jaw when it can. After you reduce it to scrap metal, you toss the head into your bag and jet out of there.
	What follows now is the only real labyrinth of obstacles in the game. Your objective is to find the room where the astronauts are begin held. Getting there is another story though! As you progress through the passageways you may come accross some sort of obstacle or trap. Depending on which button, lever or dial you shoot, will determine how you will get passed the obstacle. I haven't figured out the specifics of this yet, but the player will have to map out which object to shoot for each obstacle he/she will encounter in order to get through the maze. For example, if you are stopped by a force field, one button/lever will lower it while another will electrify you. Other obstacles can be: spikes, pits, a wall of fire, a room that closes in on you,
land mines, and triggered missles. Once you reach your destination, you free the astronauts and meet the end level boss in the next room.
	The boss of the level is a stout robot with a transformer-like body and a glass domed head. Within the dome is a large pulsating pink brain. The robot's "fingers" shoot out missles,
as well as the guns in its chest and torso. Your main objective is to shoot its elbows, then its shoulders. After that you shoot off its legs at the knee caps, and neck; until only the glass dome
remains...hovering on jets. It then uses deadly brainwaves to zap you. Once you break through the glass dome, you can splatter the brain into tiny bite-size chunks. You claim whatever's left
and exit the space station.
