				LEVEL 6 - The Nuclear Plant
				
          The level opens in a storage area filled with boxes. Some of the boxes have power-ups in them that you can collect, while others have slime creatures in them that jump out and suprise
you.  Eventually (as you progress through rooms), hoards of them drip down from the ceiling,
under doors, through cracks in the wall, and out of boxes. Once you go through the rooms and
finally shoot the last of the radioactive slime, a number of them form together and make a morphing blob-like creature. It creates an ugly humanoid type of head from its mass and tries to bite you.  If you shoot it, the holes will close up and reform the creature (hmm, sounds familiar).
If you create enough holes in it, it will have a harder time reforming.  Once that happens, you can
use your flamethrower to incinerate it into a bubbling puddle. You can then store it in a jar as a 
trophy.
          Following the slime rooms you descend (in an elevator) to the control rooms. The screen scrolls left to right. The control rooms are filled with computers, levers, buttons, dials,etc...
Mutated creatures (workers of the plant affected by the radiation) come from all sides to bite, claw, and throw stale donuts at you (?).  If you get the chance (from all the blasting you're doing)
to shoot a lever or button, a bolt of energy zaps out from a side wall and fries a group of 4 or 5 creatures in a set area.  You can do this once per button/lever, since it becomes a hole in the wall after you shoot it.  Shooting a Macintosh computer grants you an extra life (but they are hard
to find).  Along the way you can also pick up vials of  "radiation poisoning antidotes" which act as power-ups.  When you're all done blasting the "plant workers",  a voluptuous woman walks
alluringly into the room.  She's wearing a bag (mask?) on her head.  She rips the bag/mask away to reveal her face (which is essentially just a big mouth with teeth).  A tentacle-like tongue
whips out of her mouth at you.  She's nicknamed "Venus De Smilo", because like the limbless
statue, you shoot off her limbs one by one until only the head and torso remain (purple blood squirts out).  Once she is limbless, her head separates from her body and bounces around the
room (all the while, lashing her tongue out at you).  The head gradually picks up speed and becomes harder to hit.  After enough hits, her head explodes into tiny chunks onto the screen
(ewwwww!)  and you put the remains into your trophy bag.
	After the "workers" battle, you get into another elevator that takes you down to the next 
floor.  At the end of a long corridor is a door that reads: "KEEP OUT - Reactor Core!".  Obviously
you'll ignore the sign and blast your way through the door!  Once inside, you see a large room with many vats of radioactive magma.  Invisible creatures climb out of the vats in droves.  The only time they become temporarily visible is when you blast them (they take many shots to kill).
Lucky for you, though, they're slow. But if one manages to touch you, you get severe radiation
burns and lose lots of power.  Some barrels lining the walls offer smart bombs and power-ups.
When you're done wasting the "radioactive spectres", the magma oozes out of the vats and
forms the end level boss.

                                               END LEVEL BOSS

             A grossly mutated form (the size of Jabba the Hut) rises from the reactor core dripping
with radioactive magma.  It's basically a combination of all the various creatures you've fought mushed into one form.  It has multiple heads and hands/tentacles all over its body but has a centralized head inside itself (like an embryo) that will come out of its mid-section after you've
destroyed everything else.  Once the big head comes out (hey! no dirty thoughts!), it bellows with rage....so loud that it shakes the screen. It then proceeds to spew toxic wastle out of its mouth (which splatters onto the screen and does lots of damage).  Just before it hurls though,
you can manage to toss in a few grenades (the only thing that will kill it...bullets just make it madder).  If you succeed in tossing in enough grenades everytime it begins to give up its lunch,
it will feel some SEVERE indigestion and explode (causing a putrid mess of  innards to fly onto the screen and slide off).

     Somehow, after writing this level....I don't feel like eating dinner.....

(The screen will now fade to a "Congratulations" screen. Then you can enter your high score.)
