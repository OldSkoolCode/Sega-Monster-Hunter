				Bonus Levels

	The bonus levels in the game test your accuracy. There's one after levels 1, 3, and 5.
They also allow you to accumulate more points. You are armed with a hunting rifle. Ducks 
(or some other flying thing) are flying by at different speeds. The faster the duck, the more 
points its worth. Or you could shoot down planes with anti-aircraft missles...? hehe...
	Another idea I had for this level was to shoot a dart board with a dart gun. The trick to this, is that you're on a moving platform. The closer you land to the bullseye, the more points you
get. The bullseye is worth a free life since it's virtually impossible to hit.
