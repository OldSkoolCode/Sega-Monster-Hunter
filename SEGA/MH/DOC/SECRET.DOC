				Secret Rooms

	On levels 4 & 6 there are hidden panels on the wall that will reveal a secret door when you shoot them. Once you reveal the secret door, your character automatically zooms into it.

				Level 4's Secret Room

	Shooting a hidden panel will reveal a secret door, somewhere on this level. When you
enter, you see two humanoids lying on top of money piles (looking oddly similar to Ken & Kevin).
They are sipping a fine wine and clutch a scantly clad female under each arm. They magically reveal the "indestructo" laser blaster to you. The humanoids can not be destroyed. If they are shot at,  you will lose points. The humanoids also give you power-ups and loads of points. Then
they magically vanish (with the money and girls, of course).  The laser blaster can destroy any
monster with 1 shot. It has a limited charge though. Once you use it on one range of monsters,
you'll go back to your old weapon when you reach their boss. There's an exit at the back of the room that leads back to the area where you found the secret door.

				Level 6's Secret Room
	
	The large room has rows of cubicles with strange humanoid creatures in them. They sit
staring blankly at computer monitors. You'll get points for shooting them (putting them out of their misery, hehe), and their macintoshes. The screen scrolls left to right. At the end of the row is their boss (literally!). A deformed mutant stands in front of his desk with a large whip (and he
strangely resembles Richard Hicks!). The weak spot to aim for is the cranium. If you shoot at that a number of times, he'll finally blow up into a gust of hot air. Shooting up the desk, you'll find
power-ups and a new weapon. You get a ton of extra points and the programmers' gratitude (worth an extra life). A door at the back, leads out to the point where you entered the secret door.
You continue the level from there.
