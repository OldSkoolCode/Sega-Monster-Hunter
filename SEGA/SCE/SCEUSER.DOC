Re:	New version of Scat

  Version 2.20 of SCE (formerly Scat) is being released. There are some
  significant changes and bug fixes.


  The changes include the following:


    -  File names are now uniquely specified by type.  The general .GEN
    suffix is no longer used. Users will need to rename their files
    to reflect this.  Map files have the suffix .GMP; animation files
    have the suffix .GAN.  This means that the load/save requestor
    boxes will only show files of interest depending on the mode in which
    SCE is invoked.


    -  When loading palettes, SCE asks if a map or sprite palette is needed
    and then shows a list of map (.GMP) or sprite (.GAN) files as
    appropriate.

    -  Saving/loading of files has been automated somewhat in that the user
    can now type in part of a name and SCE will append the correct file
    extension, etc.

    -  The name of the product has been changed to SCE (pronounced 'ski')
    from Scat. SCE stands for Sega Character Editor. The options remain
    the same. The latest version is 2.20.


  Bugs have been fixed, as follows:

   -  Downloading sprites now places them at approximately their vertical
   position in SCE. The program was failing to adjust for the menu bar,
   thus pushing the sprites down too far.

   -  The brush pickup and x draw functions were working on even pixels only.
   That is, skipping every other pixel. This turns out to have been due
   to the mouse driver. Use of the logitech version 5 or 6 mouse driver
   with the Microsoft mouse solves this.

   -  The invert color for brush pickup and character mode cursor is now
   a special white that can be seen even against a white background.  This
   solves the problem of invisible or difficult to see cursors and
   crosshairs.

   -  The problem of trying to load a sprite file in map mode and vice versa,
   has been rendered moot by the first change described. However, if files
   are not correctly named (for example a sprite file has a suffix of
   .GMP), the system will detect this and issue a message.

   -  A black rectangle was being left behind in the character edit window.
   This has been changed to use the color 0 of palette 0, to match the
   character box outline.

   -  Animation sequences of 40 or more frames were crashing the Genesis. Now
   a message is issued and the sequence is not downloaded.


   -  The speed settings for viewing animations have been adjusted to work in
   1/32nd of a second increments. Setting 0 means no delay, setting 1
   means 1/32nd of a second delay, 2 means a 1/16th of a second delay,
   etc. In addition, the frame speed being downloaded to the genesis
   was being multiplied by 2 for some reason. This is no longer being done.
   The net effect is more control over animation speed, and faster
   animations on the Genesis.

   -  Some bugs with the F3 File Load interface have been fixed.
   I have identified some others that were not on the list. These will
   be fixed in a future release.

   -  Picking NEW on the map menu will no longer leave a character displayed
   where the cursor was when the selection was made.

   -  The 'primitives' drawing options in the image window (pixel draw,
   line, rectangle, circle, etc) no longer spill over onto the map
   window. In addition, the menu bar is updated to show the user
   what action is being taken (for example, 'line draw mode').

   -  Selecting a Genesis download in an invalid situation now produces an
   error message instead of no action.

   -  The undo command now 'undoes' just the last brush action on the map 
   screen, instead of undoing all brushes dropped onto the map.

   -  There were various mouse handling bugs too abtruse to mention in detail.
   The ones I found have been fixed.  However it is possible that others
   remain. If you find one, please let me know.
