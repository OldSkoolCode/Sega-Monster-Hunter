MAKELOGO - source file converter program
========================================

Definitions:-

ASSEMBLER = {SNASM | MICROTEC | SIERRA}
FILENAME = MSDOS FILE SPECIFIER


Invocation:-

MAKELOGO /ASSEMBLER INFILE[.ANY]
This will make a file which can be assembled by the 
assembler specified.


Overview:-

Makelogo supports a range of file selection and inclusion
operations, which are based on the C language pre-processor.
Makelogo's INCLUDE is NOT nestable and any attempt to do so
will result in an error when Makelogo is invoked. The string
substitutions made with #DEFINE are NOT expanded recursively.

The following operations are supported:-

#CASEASM,#ENDCASE,#INCLUDE,#DEFINE

Every command line must start with a hash (#) symbol and be
followed immediately by the command word. Makelogo converts
all characters from the hash to the first space character
(or end of the line if there are no spaces) into upper case
internally, so that it is not case sensitive to the keywords.
Additionally, Makelogo does not copy lines beginning with a
hash through to the output.
Finally, for the SIERRA asembler, MAKELOGO strips all lines
beginning with a semicolon (as the assembler complains
about them!)


Operations:-

#CASEASM=ASMTYPE
...
#CASEASM=ASMTYPE
...
#CASEASM=ASMTYPE
...
#ENDCASE

e.g.
#CASEASM=SNASM
	dc.b	'Assembled with SNASM',0
#CASEASM=MICROTEC
	dc.b	'Not assembled with SNASM or SIERRA',0
#ENDCASE


The '=' is important and ASMTYPE is any of the options
in the ASSEMBLER set above. There may be more than one
#CASEASM with the same ASMTYPE before an #ENDCASE, which
is not checked for by Makelogo; in this case, all of
the pieces of code after the matching #CASEASM and before
either a non matching #CASEASM or an #ENDCASE, will be 
copied to the output. An error will occur if an invalid
assembler type is specified. #CASEASM cannot be nested.


#INCLUDE FILENAME

e.g.
#INCLUDE data\snasm.dat

The space seperator is required. The include file will now
be scanned and any of the other operations in it will be
obeyed (#INCLUDE will force an error) until the end of
the include file is reached, where the main file will be
resumed. An error will occur if the specified FILENAME
cannot be found. #INCLUDE cannot be nested.


#DEFINE string1 string2

e.g.
#DEFINE NAME SEGA LOGODEMO
will replace every occurence of the 4 characters NAME
with the 13 characters SEGA LOGODEMO

The space seperators are required to delimit both ends of
string1, which cannot contain spaces. Each occurence
of string1 in a line not beginning with a hash will be
substituted by string2. Note that every character in string1
forms part of the string and it is delimited by spaces
and that every character in string2 including spaces forms
part of the string and that it is delimited by ' ' at the
start and newline at the end. The search for string1 IS case
sensitive, so for example, 'THIS' and 'This' are NOT the
same string.
