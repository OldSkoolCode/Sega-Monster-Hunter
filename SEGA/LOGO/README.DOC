LOGO DEMONSTRATION
==================

The logo demonstration consists of several files with
.ANY extensions. These files contain a fairly generic
68000 assembly source syntax. They cannot be directly
assembled by any of SNASM, SIERRA or MICROTEC without
first being processed by MAKELOGO.

MAKELOGO should be invoked on MAIN.ANY only, as the
other .ANY files are included in MAIN.ANY, so as to
produce one output file, which will have the same base
name (MAIN), but with an extension defaulting to the
assembler's default input extension. (68K,S,SRC)

MAKELOGO is somewhat over specified for doing this
simple file conversion job. Initially, I wrote the
demonstration for the SNASM system, which has many
very powerful features. However, to get the assembler
file to actually assemble under the different assemblers,
I have had to whittle away the non (Motorola) standard
code, to be left with code to assemble under the
lowest common demominator, which appears to be the
SIERRA assembler.

for example:-
to produce a MICROTEC assembler file

MAKELOGO /microtec main

this produces the output file MAIN.SRC

The corresponding assembler file can then be assembled
(and linked) with the following sequences:-

SNASM
-----
\snasm\snasm68k /p /k main,logodemo

to produce LOGODEMO.BIN (pure binary)

SIERRA
------
this will require a file named SLDR.SPC in the current
directory containing a space character!

\sierra\asm68k main.s
\sierra\link68 -o main.lnk main.o
\sierra\sldr -St main.lnk logodemo.abs

to produce LOGODEMO.ABS (S1 records)

MICROTEC
--------

\microtec\asm68k main
\microtec\lnk68k -ologodemo main

to produce LOGODEMO.ABS (S2 records)
